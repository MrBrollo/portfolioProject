            <h3>So how did i get into programming?</h3>
            <p>It all started when I was a kid, I simply loved play videogames, especially the ones centered around
                puzzles, strategies and exploration. I've always been a curious kid, and growing older I started asking
                myself why are things made the way they are? I used to spend a lot of hours sitting in front of my PC
                just playing or browsing the Internet, as I saw it as an opportunity to learn even more. Studying HTML,
                CSS and programming in general is an experience that makes for personal growth and the more I learn, the
                more I love it! So thanks for visiting my website, feel free to contact me if you want to ask anything!
